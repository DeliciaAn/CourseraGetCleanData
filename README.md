### Explanation of each file
run_analysis.R: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names in a appropriate way
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidy.txt:
This file is a tidy data set which is produced in run_analysis.R.

CodeBook.md:
This document describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work. The detailed information can be found in this CodeBook.md file.
